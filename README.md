# Outputs With Interfaces & Sensor Taming

As we work with other devices, devices that we want to control, we need to work with other power supplies to support them. They require more current to operate than our microcontroller pins will supply. Enter, transistors and relays. Transistors and relays interface with the arduino. They take the voltage from an output pin on our microcontroller and act as switches, turning out other devices on. Transistors and relays allow us to work with different loads and the power supplys they require.


Use a transistor or a relay in conjunction with a motor. Use the arduino to control when and how the motor turns on. Use a variable resistor as the controlling input to the arduino. A variable resistor will give you different levels of input. Utilize several of these to control different states of the motor. Think about time, frequency and amount.

Upload your code to your github and create a pull request for your branch. Document the circuit - both visually (image, video, drawing) and using [fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/). Upload these items to your blog. Comment out and reference your code.


Bonus for using: Edges (falling or rising), thresholds, and peaks.
